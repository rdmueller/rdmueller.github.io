My goal ist to make the software-world a better place one doc at a time.

I truely believe that the current biggest problem of the software-world isn't technology, skills or quality in the broad sense but missing documentation. 

This is yet another blog mostly written by a Grails Full-Stack-Developer (me). Mostly, because I hope other will join in and contribute their thoughs.

The Blog uses github pages together with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) as engine. Template from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/)
