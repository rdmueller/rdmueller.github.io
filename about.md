My goal ist to make the software-world a better place one doc at a time.

I truely believe that one of the biggest problems of the software-world isn't technology, skills or quality in the broad sense but missing documentation. Another is missing simplicity.

Regarding the documentation - there are some open source projects out there which do have great user documentation, but as soon as you try to change the code, your are on your own - no documentation of the solution architecture. I only remember one open source project with a proper documentation of the solution architecture (http://biking.michael-simons.eu/docs/index.html), but maybe I don't know enough OS projects :-)

So my aim is to build on [the works of Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka](http://arc42.de) to make use of arc42 even easier.
