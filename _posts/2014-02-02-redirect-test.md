This is just a test on how I could redirect old blog posts
It seems that I need to have 40 words of abstracts in order to avoid a redirect from the overview page.

Oh, how much are 40 words? I don't know exactly, but Intellij should display a word count!
That would make it much easier to see progress when writing documentation.

Let's give this another try. Should be forty by now, shouldn't it?
