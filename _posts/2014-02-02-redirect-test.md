This is just a test on how I could redirect old blog posts
It seems that I need to have 40 words of abstracts in order to avoid a redirect from the overview page.

<html>
    <head>
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://docs-as-co.de">
	<link rel="canonical" href="https://docs-as-co.de" />
    </head>
</html>
