The world is changing. With the global climate crisis and now the corona lockdown you have to find new way to share your experience and wisdom.
The time to fly from continent to continent in order to speak at conferences is over.
Virtual conferences are the new normal.

With that in mind, it is important to adapt to this change.
I already managed to get some first hand experience through my remote first team, watching some other remote speakers (you know, it is best to learn from others!) and giving a remote talk myself.

Here is what I've learned...

## familiarize yourself with the software system

## get decent hardware

### good camera

### good microphone

## chose a good background

## make sure to have good lighting

## be prepared

hm? are these the right slides?

## make sure that you will be undisturbed

## ist your network stable?

other people start a video stream
wifi

## be prepared to speak "into a hole"

## Presenter, Pencil

## avoid high resolution screens / webcam

## expect people to watch on a smartphone
