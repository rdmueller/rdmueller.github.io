It is easy to [render AsciiDoc as HTML](https://rdmueller.github.io/gradle_asciidoc_build/) and [with the beta version of asciidoctor-pdf, it is also easy to render your document as PDF](https://rdmueller.github.io/pdf-output/). But if most of your project documentation already resides in an easy to edit wiki - why not also render your solution architecture to the wiki?

This blog post will show you how to render asciidoc as part of your [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) space.
