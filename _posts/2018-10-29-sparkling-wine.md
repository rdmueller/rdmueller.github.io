In order to optimize docToolchain for Mac and Linux, I wanted to give Sparx Enterprise Architect a try on a *nix environment.

I once already tried to install EA on Wine on Ubuntu within Hypervisor on Windows 10, but with my first try I didn't succeed.
I tried to follow the [instructions on the Sparx website](https://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/14.0/product_information/enterprise_architect_linux.html), but it made the impression that some of those instructions are a bit outdated.

So today I just thought "hey, you should check the [wine home-page](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu) and follow these instructions". 
That was a success!

Now with a Sparx EA 14.1 running on my machine on Ubuntu, expect some updates to docToolchain soo ðŸ˜Ž
